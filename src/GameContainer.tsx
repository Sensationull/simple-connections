since we're managing the state for the answers here,

potential for useContext? Gameboard is just passing props anyways
Instead of the answerkey holding just the sets of answers, maybe 
make an array of objects with an answer Set on it and a description,
then you can just pass down the specific set that matches. Array.find...
